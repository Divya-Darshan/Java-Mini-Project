# 🧩 OOP Mini Project in Java with Swing GUI 🎨

> 💻 A mini project built using Java's Object-Oriented Programming principles with a user-friendly interface powered by Swing.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java and uses **Swing** for building a graphical user interface (GUI). The backend logic is implemented using Java classes, methods, and inheritance principles, while the frontend interacts through the Swing framework.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java (OOP Backend)** – Handles the core logic using:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation & Abstraction
- **Java Swing (Frontend GUI)** – Used for:
  - Interactive UI components (buttons, labels, text fields, etc.)
  - Event handling (ActionListeners)
  - Window management and layout

---

## 📂 Project Structure


---

## 🎯 Features

- 📦 Clean separation of frontend (Swing) and backend (Java classes)
- 🧠 Demonstrates key OOP principles in a real-world application
- 🎨 Responsive and interactive GUI
- 🧩 Modular and extendable design

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
4. Run `Main.java` to launch the application.

---

## 💡 Sample Use Case

- A login/signup form, calculator, quiz app, or small inventory system
- GUI built with Swing (`JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, etc.)
- Backend handles logic like validation, data processing, etc.
